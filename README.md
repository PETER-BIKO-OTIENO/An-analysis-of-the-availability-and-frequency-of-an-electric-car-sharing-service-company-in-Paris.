Overview

In this project, you will be working as a data scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company. You have been tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time by solving for the following research question;

Research Question

Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.

What is the most popular hour for returning cars?

What station is the most popular overall?

At the most popular picking hour?

What postal code is the most popular for picking up Blue cars? Does the most popular station belong to that postal code?

What is the most popular picking hour?

Do the results change if you consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Blue cars? 

Your final deliverable will be a data report which will comprise the following sections;

You can get the data and the dataset description for this  project here [http://bit.ly/autolib_dataset) (Links to an external site) and here respectively [Link] (Links to an external site.).  

The dataset contains data collected for a period of 9 days. The dataset may take a bit of some time to load [~ 10 minutes]. 

Hint:

To compute usage, we will need to understand that we have to join successive (in time) measures/counters for a given station, as the difference will tell whether a car was picked up, returned, or nothing happened.

The CRISP-DM methodology will guide while working on the Data Report. The Data Report has an objective account, with insights majorly coming from the dataset. However, you can refer to external information for supporting information.
